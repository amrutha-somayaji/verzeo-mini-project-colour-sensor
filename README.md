# verzeo-mini-project-colour-sensor
Colour sensor is used in variety of application like segregation and separation. In this project, a circuit is developed in order to sense the three most basic colours around us, red, green,blue.

The components used are RGB led for indication of the colour, LDR to detect the light/colour and Arduino Uno as microcontroller.

The Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) is used to sense the amount of reflected light from the object. As we know different colours emit different wavelenghts of light, hence by bringing the LDR infront of different colours, different readings at the LDR were observed and the code was written to turn on the indicator LEDs.

The circuit is made in such a way that, when red coloured object is brought near to the LDR, red LED on the circuit glows indicating that the colour is red. Similarlly for the colours green and blue.
